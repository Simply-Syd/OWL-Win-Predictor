# OWL-Win-Predictor
This program was made for my 2021 senior project at the University of Mississippi. 
I wanted to develop a program that could predict the winner of an Overwatch League game given teams' heroes as input. 

Original data comes from the Overwatch League Stats Lab: https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab

When I was writing this program, I only had 2018, 2019, and the first half of 2020 data to work with, but the website has been updated since then.
This was my first time working with pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn. 

To write this program, I used Python 3.8.5 Anaconda Individual Distribution.
The Anaconda Navigator comes with IDEs compatible with Jupyter Notebooks, but I used Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension.

Comments are included in my code that explain what I'm doing.
